### Micro template implementing rankings with the help of Pyterrier

This repository contains an adapted version of the [STELLA Micro-Template](https://github.com/stella-project/stella-micro-template). It is implemented with the help of [pyterrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) - the Python wrapper to [Terrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-core). The rankings are made with a tfidf-based algorithm.
